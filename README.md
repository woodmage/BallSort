# BallSort
A simple ball sorting game.

Okay, this game uses the mouse.  Left click on a flask to grab a ball (or balls if more than one of the same color are at top).  Left click on the flask where you want to move them.  Middle click (on a flask) to request a new flask.  Different levels have different numbers of flasks available.  Right click will normally unselect the balls you selected with a left click.  None of these mouse controls work while animations are occurring, except the right click which will then abort the animation and complete the move.  The object of the game is to sort the balls so that each flask is filled with all the balls of a color or empty.

All games and programs have bugs.  This one has two bugs I'm aware of.  The first is that occasionally the game freezes during an animation.  If this happens, just right click and all should be fixed.  The second bug is that occasionally (not very often), the game doesn't correctly notice when you have all the balls sorted.  For this, simply click on one of the flasks and it should then notice you won that level.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the game!
